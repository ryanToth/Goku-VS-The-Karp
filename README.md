I did not make nor do I own any of the sprites or backgorunds that I used in the game, I only modified a few images I found in order simulate a little bit of animation. Use the arrow keys to move Goku around, press the space bar to shoot the magikarp. If you hold the space bar, you will see the charging meter fill. Once it is full, you can release the space bar to shoot a charged shot which does not disappear after hitting an enemy, it also does extra damage against a boss. A boss appears for a boss fight on every 5th wave.To play the game, open up the "Goku VS The Karp" .jar file.  

UPDATE: Pause now works (press p). The high score feature now works. In order for it to work the "highscore" folder must be in the same directory as the .jar file or the "src" folder depending on how you choose to run the program. A few visual tweaks as well but nothing big.

NOTE: Works better on MAC rather than WINDOWS
